# Portfolio-web-page
This is my first portfolio web page!. ver 1.0.0
I built this static page with HTML5, CSS.
While this is not the first web page I have worked on, this is the first I built from scratch.

# Project
This project was focused on building a web page that demonstrates the proper use of accessibility functions, contrast and color theory,
and proper scope methods in developing the program itself.

# Challenges
The biggest challenge for me in this project was to begin mapping out and organizing myy code. It was improtant to make sure that eveyrhting was organized and carried tags or labels, for ease of access within my CSS file. Through scope, I was able to help myself by implementing clean code, all while documenting my work within my files to better understand what it was I was accomplishing.
